<!-- ## About Me -->

I am currently a PhD student in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) advised by [Kenny Q. Zhu](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~kzhu/). Before that, I received the bachelor degree in Computer Science from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2018. 


# Research
        
I am generally interested in natural language processing. Current interests include: 
- Natural language generation
- Dialogue understanding and generation
- Abstractive summarization
